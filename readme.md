# Jack's Updated Portfolio

This is an updated portfolio for my 2nd week homework assignment. As opposed to the assignment from week 1, We were allowed to get code from Bootstrap, which greatly increased the speed of creation.

## Issues

Some bootstrap code is incredibly fragile, and that was something I was unaware of until I used it myself. That being said, it was INCREDIBLY useful, and I would gladly look past that shortcoming for the speed and ease of website making that bootstrap assists with.
